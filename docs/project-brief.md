# StripperNFT Project Brief

## Background Information

The creator market for sex workers is dominated by OnlyFans (OF). In late summer 2021 OF announced it would ban pornography from its service. This gives us the opportunity to grab some marketshare of their users and creators. We do not want to create a clone of OF, we would like to create a platform that improves the user experience for both creators and subscribers.

### Weak points of OnlyFans

* OF takes 20% of all content sales
* Users purchases are sunk costs

#### OnlyFans House Fee is Way Too High

OF takes a 20% cut from every transaction on their platform. That is outrageous and it needs to be lower. Creators should have more ownership of the content they create. Our platforom will reduce the house fee to around 5%.

#### Creators Rely On Revenue From One-Time-Only Sales

Creators can sell content in various ways on OF. One of these ways is a simple one-time fee for lifetime access to content. This creates a dynamic for the creator with two possible strategies. The first strategy is to create additional content to sell to current subscribers. The second is to expand their subscriber base so as to sell old content to new people.

### Strengths of our platform

With this project we aim to provide a radically differnt way to monetize content. A creator will create, say, a video and post it to our platform. Our platform will mint an NFT that points to this video. The initial sale will net the creator 95% of the asking price, the house will take 5%. Additional sales will net the creator 20% of each subsequent transaction of that NFT. We will accomplish this by the following mechanisms.

1. A creator will mint an NFT. This NFT will link to a preview version of the creator's content.
1. StripperNFT.com (or whichever domain we manage to buy) will host the full version of the creator's content.
1. A fan will be able to purchase the NFT just like they would any other NFT.
1. When the fan visits StripperNFT they will authenticate with a Web3 client such as Metamask.
1. The Metamask client will provide proof that the user is the current owner of the NFT.
1. This user, and only this user, will be able to access the full version of the creator's content on StripperNFT.com

This allows the user to sell the NFT when they no longer need it. That creates a dynamic of its own. If a creator on OnlyFans lists an item at $100, a user is not very likely to purchase it because it is a sunk cost. However, if the user knows they can sell the NFT at a later date, they might be more inclined to purchase content for $100.

Additionally, the creator gets a royalty fee of each subsequent sale of the NFT. This creates further dynamics. The creator is incentivized to create content that will at least retain its value. They will aslo get feedback about pricing their content.

## Objectives

* Empower creators to keep a higher cut of their sales
* Give users the ability to recoup money spent on content
